Hi! I am a final year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I have experience in dealing with large high-dimensional datasets from a variety of sources. They range from Santander Bank's trasaction data to Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data including medical adminitration record, enounter data, flowsheet data, etc.

Having taken courses on Statistical Machine Learning, Longitudinal Data Analysis, Advanced Computational Genomics, Data Mining, etc. I have worked on a plethora of projects dealing with stock market data, NYC Open data, Genmome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS).
